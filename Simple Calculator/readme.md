# Calculator Program

This is a simple calculator program written in Python. It allows the user to perform various arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, floor division, modulus, and exponentiation.

## Usage

1. Run the program: `python calculator.py`
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to select an operation and enter the required numbers.
3. The program will display the result of the selected operation.

## Operations

- **Addition (1):** Adds two numbers.
- **Subtraction (2):** Subtracts the second number from the first.
- **Multiplication (3):** Multiplies two numbers.
- **Division (4):** Divides the first number by the second (non-zero divisor).
- **Floor Division (5):** Returns the largest integer less than or equal to the division result.
- **Modulus (6):** Returns the remainder of the division.
- **Exponentiation (7):** Raises the first number to the power of the second.

## Input Validation

The program validates user input to ensure that the entered values are valid numbers. If an invalid input is detected, the user will be prompted to enter a correct input.

## Error Handling

The program handles division by zero error and prompts the user to enter a non-zero value for the divisor when attempting division.

Feel free to use and modify this program according to your needs.
